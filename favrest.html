                While it may not be a restaurant, I definitely enjoy cooking for myself in my own kitchen. 
                I host a family dinner every Sunday, it's my favorite day because I get to share my food with others. 
                Cooking is definitely not a chore for me.

                My favorite menu item is their brisket burnt ends. You can't go wrong with good BBQ.
